## PHASES OF MODEL ##
# Pretraining
	- reflects the frequency of preventative and causal cases
# Habituation
	- reflects to what infants are exposed during habituatin
# Test
	- reflects the test events on which infants are tested




## OBJECT REPRESENTATIONS ##
# 12 bits
# Pretraining 
	- generative causes will have some combination of the first 6 bits on
	- preventative causes will have some combination of the final six bits on

# Habituation
	- the first habituation stimuli will have a single bit on in the region that corresponds to the first six bits and a single bit on in the region of the second 6 bits.
	- the second habituation stimuli will have a different single bit on in the region that corresponds to teh first six bits and also a different single bit on in the region htat corresponds to the second 6 bits

# Test
	- the stimuli used during training would be identical to those used during habituation, albeit with different effect combinations per the test trials we'd use.
